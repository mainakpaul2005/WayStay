# WayStay â€” Next.js + shadcn-style UI boilerplate

This is a minimal Next.js app (App Router) with Tailwind CSS and a small set of local shadcn-style UI components (Button, Card, Typography). The components live in `components/ui/*` and are intentionally local so you can modify them freely.

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd D:\Coding\Projects\WayStay
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 after running `npm run dev`.

Notes:
- This scaffold uses local components that follow shadcn/ui naming and API patterns. If you prefer the official package or a different set of components, replace `components/ui` with the package of your choice.
- Tailwind, PostCSS and TypeScript configs are included.
